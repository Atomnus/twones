  <h2>The Beginning</h2>
  <p>So. You came, huh? I thought you would. Though the <i>real</i> question is, can you find the secrets?</p>
  <p>I'm assumming you already know how this thing works. But, just in case, i'll explain it again. I add secrets to this website every day or so. You have to find them. Although it never ends, I occasionally add surprises and "endings" even though I won't stop updating. The real reason of this website is shrouded in mystery, and you <i>might,</i> just <i>might</i> be able to find it in the "ending" I talked about. If you're stuck, I made a handy changelog to keep track of everything I add. If you find it, that is. After some time, this website will branch out farther and farther. This therefore makes the secrets harder to find as you progress. A turquoise page with black words, like this one, means that you have done the right thing and found the correct secret. A black page, with red words tell you to go back, because you have found the incorrect secret. That seems simple enough, does it? I hope so. Well, all I can say at this point is, good luck!</p>
